                    <h4>Little Story</h4>
                    <p>In France throughout the Middle Ages, guilds had monopolies on many aspects of prepared food. For example, charcutiers were the guild who prepared cooked meats for sale. If you did not belong to that particular guild, it was illegal to sell cooked meat in any form. </p>
                    <p>In 1765, a man named Boulanger added cooked lamb to a stew he sold in his shop near the Louvre. The caterer’s guild sued him, but Boulanger won the case. Over the next 20 years leading up to the French Revolution, more shops like Boulanger’s began opening in Paris.</p>
